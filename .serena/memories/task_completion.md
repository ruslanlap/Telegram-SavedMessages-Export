# Task Completion Checklist
- Run a quick syntax check (`python3 -m py_compile telegram_to_notion.py`) after edits.
- If changing CLI/export logic, exercise a dry run (`--dry-run`) with sample filters to verify output paths and prompts.
- No automated tests or linters in repo; manual verification of Notion/Telegram integration is required when credentials are available.
